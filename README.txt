Welcome to the Desert Tower Defence Game 
by Valtteri Kortteisto.

The program is executed via Game.scala in the folder 
Deser Tower Defence/src/user_interface.

There is a help function in game if you
are looking for that.

Known bugs in the game:
- the range is limited by the  projectile's 'age',
  if the range exceeds something around 320, the projectiles just dissappear
- the fastforwarding function sometimes work to the players disadvantage
  by reducing the chance the bullets hit the target, especially with
  fast defence speeds
- the mobs walking animation freezes in the last square on the path
